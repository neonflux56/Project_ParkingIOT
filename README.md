# Project_ParkingIOT

Trying to find a parking space in a city center isn't just frustrating at times, but is
also a waste of productive time and resource for everyone. As we all know, “Time is
money!”. Additionally, unnecessary fuel usage is also a prime factor to be considered
when drivers move around aimlessly only to find a place to park the vehicle. Through this
project, we would like to address this social issue for a better change in the parking
system.
